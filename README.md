# Logic-gates-with-neural-network

A shallow, 2-layer Neural Network implemented in Java. The model is based on the Python implementation from the Week 2 of this [Deep Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). The network is tested against the truth tables of four different logic gates: NAND, XNOR, XOR, NOR. It learns to predict if the output of the chosen logic gate is either True or False for the given input.

The goal of this small project was to improve my understanding of the Neural Networks design by building it from scratch (including my own Matrix 'library'). I chose Java, because it was the language I was the most familiar with at that time.
